    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>The MegaPlay mobile game (the "App") is developed by MegaStudios (Anish Sahani). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your information. This Privacy Policy explains how MegaPlay handles user data in relation to the App.</p>
    <p><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> MegaPlay does not collect, use, or share any personally identifiable information from users. The App does not request or store your name, email address, phone number, contacts, location data, or any other personal information. There are no login or account features that require personal data.</p>
    <p><strong>Advertisements and Non-Personal Data:</strong> MegaPlay displays third-party advertisements through Adsterra. Only generic, non-personal ad data may be used for this purpose (for example, device type or anonymized usage statistics). No personal or sensitive information is collected or shared with Adsterra or any advertisers. We do not perform any user profiling or targeted advertising.</p>
<h3>Third-Party Advertisements</h3>
<p>
MegaPlay displays advertisements provided by third-party ad networks, including but not limited to Adsterra. These advertisements are served and controlled entirely by the respective third-party providers.
</p>

<p>
MegaPlay does not create, select, modify, review, or control the content of third-party advertisements. As such, we do not guarantee the accuracy, appropriateness, or suitability of any advertisement displayed within the App.
</p>

<p>
Any images, text, links, or media shown in advertisements are the sole responsibility of the respective advertisers and ad networks. MegaPlay shall not be held responsible or liable for any offensive, misleading, inappropriate, or objectionable advertising content that may be displayed.
</p>

<p>
Users interact with third-party advertisements at their own discretion and risk. Any data collected by advertisers is governed by their own privacy policies.
</p>
    <p><strong>PHP Environment and Permissions:</strong> The App runs on a PHP backend environment, but this does not involve any personal data processing. MegaPlay does not require or request any special device permissions. In particular, the App does not access your camera, microphone, contacts, location, or any other private features of your device. The only permission needed is Internet access to load ads and update content.</p>
    <p><strong>Data Security:</strong> Since MegaPlay does not collect personal data, there is no personal information to protect. We take reasonable measures to secure any minimal technical data (such as anonymous performance logs) that we hold, but this data cannot be used to identify you as an individual.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact MegaPlay Studios (Anish Sahani) at <a href="mailto:gamedeveloper988@gmail.com">gamedeveloper988@gmail.com</a>.</p>
